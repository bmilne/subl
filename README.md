## subl 

The subl repo contains a chef-solo based installer for Sublime Text 2. This is for sharing my own personal module and keybinding preferences between OSX and ubuntu desktops.  Updates can be made on either platfrom and then shared by pushing back up to github.

## Recovering Emacs Users
I have used emacs for the past 15 years, rectangle edits, kbd macros, snippets, TAGS you name it.  This editor has all those and more and its alot faster.  The sublemacspro package gets you most of the standard emacs keybindings but its worth checking out a few of the videos at the URL below to understand how to use multi-select and some other power features that will be new to emacs cognescenti.

## Install Ruby Version Manager

```
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby
```
## Bootstrap chef

Bootstrap installs rubygems from source and the chef gem.  This script only need be run once to configure ruby and chef appropriately. 

```
> ./bootstrap.rb
```
## Installation 
The installer will bootstrap chef-solo if necessary and the run 'chef-solo -c solo.rb -j install.json' from the kitchen directory

```
> ./install.rb
```
Note the message below message is a harmless bug in the current ohai gem and can safely be ignored. 

```
sh: 1: Permission denied"
```

## Installation

## Push
In the event that you add new packages or keybindings the push recipe will tar up the current state of sublime on either platform and push it to github

## Keybindings

OSX and linux keybindings are shared.  The keybindings are linux defaults with overrides largely definded by sublemacspro (i.e. very emacs like).  User overrides are tabulated below.
